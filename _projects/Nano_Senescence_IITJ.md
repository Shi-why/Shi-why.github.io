**Project Background:** Aging is considered to be one of the key drivers of numerous age-related diseases. Senescence is a hallmark of aging and it is characterized by increased lysosomal beta galactosidase expression(Senescence associated beta galactosidase). Senolytic drugs target SCs that accumulate with age and at sites of choronic conditions
