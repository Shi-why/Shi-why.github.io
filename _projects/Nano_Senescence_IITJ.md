     Mouse fibroblasts(NIH/3T3) were stained to observe Beta Galactosidase expression imaged through inverted microscopy. Left- NIH/3T3 cells Right- NIH/3T3 cells treated with H2O2 to induce Stress-induced premature senescence. Blue stained cells indicate positive Senescence associated beta-galactosidase expression.
