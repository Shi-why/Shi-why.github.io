**Project Background:** Literature shows senescence to be one of the key drivers of numerous age-related diseases through the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) that can induce inflammatory states throughout the body. It is characterized by an increased lysosomal beta-galactosidase expression (Senescence-associated beta-galactosidase). Senolytic drugs can target and cause apoptosis of SCs that accumulate with age and at sites of numerous chronic conditions. Nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery enables controlled release, higher target concentrations, first-pass metabolism bypass, and lower off-site interactions of the target drug. In particular, Flavonol senolytics like Quercetin and Fisetin have poor oral bioavailabilities given their low aqueous solubility.  Mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) have been shown to be efficient drug carriers due to their porosity and drug-loading capacities. The surface functionalization of MSNs enables the gating of these pores as well as selective targeting and drug release in cells of interest. I use this principle to load senolytic drugs into MSNs and gate-them.
