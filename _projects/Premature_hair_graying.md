**Project Background**The motivation for understanding the presence of gray hair in younger population came when I noticed the silver strands in my hair, as well as in the scalps of many of my batchmates. I wanted to explore whether medical students were particularly predisposed to this condition. Literature has shown Premature hair graying(PHG) is an indicator of signs of stem cell depletion in hair follicles, a mechanism also common to aging. The connection to increased rates of aging interested me even further.
