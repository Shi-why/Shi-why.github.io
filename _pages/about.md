I am a recently graduated doctor from Jodhpur, India. Despite having a clinical background, I am not limited to the conventional roles of a doctor. I aspire to address the root causes of many diseases by studying the mechanisms and interventions of aging. I believe that my clinical perspective and experience in India can bring a valuable and innovative approach to the field of longevity research, which has global implications for an aging population. To understand aging better, I have begun my journey on the path of research and discovery. On this website, you can explore my published works, research experience, education, and resume.
