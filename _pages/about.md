I am a recently graduated doctor from Dr. S.N. Medical College, Jodhpur, India. Over the last four years, I have gained a motivation to study the mechanisms underlying the process of human aging and potential interventions that can address age-related diseases. In line with this, I have worked on studying the epigenetics of aging and nanomedicine-based anti-senescence treatments. I am further interested in deciphering the epigenetic and metabolic dysregulation with aging, while also exploring novel and universal biomarkers for senescence. On this website, you can explore my published works, research projects, education, and resume.
