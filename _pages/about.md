I am a recently graduated doctor from Jodhpur, India. I have a strong clinical background, but I am not limited to the conventional roles of a doctor. I aspire to address the root causes of many diseases by studying the mechanisms and interventions of aging. I believe that my clinical perspective and experience in India can bring a valuable and innovative approach to the field of longevity research, which has global implications for an aging population. To understand aging better, I have begun my journey on the path of research and discovery. I believe my strengths align with the essential demands of science, such as problem-solving, perseverance with multiple experiments, and learning from failures along with an unending curiosity for the biological world. I have familiarized myself with the basics of biochemistry, molecular biology, epigenetics, bioinformatics, and nanomedicine. I am currently looking for research opportunities in biological/biomedical research labs focusing on aging.
