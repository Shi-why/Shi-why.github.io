<p>I am a recently graduated doctor from Dr. S.N. Medical College, Jodhpur, India. Despite having a clinical background, I am not limited to the conventional roles of a doctor. I aspire to study the mechanisms and interventions of aging that can address the root causes of numerous diseases. My clinical perspective and experience in India can bring a valuable and innovative approach to the field of longevity research, which has global implications for an aging population. To understand aging better, I have begun my journey of research and discovery. This has included work on one of the molecular biology and epigenetics of aging and more recently nanomedicine to target aging. On this website, you can explore my published works, research experience, education, and resume.</p>
